# Zigman
Zigman allows you to create MEMZ-like trojans (destroy MBR, after that do things on the display). \
Written in C#. Has a payload manager, payload queue and a lot of P/Invokes.

## Amogus Trojan
It is a trojan, that uses Zigman Engine. An example, sort of. \
It looks very cool (and sus, too). Download it on the Releases tab.
