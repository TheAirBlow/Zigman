# Zigman
Zigman allows you to create GDI malware and also destroy the MBR, Partition Table and the Registry. \
Written in C#. Manages payloads and threads for you. Also has a lot of P/Invokes builtin.

## Disclaimer
This is only for educational purposes. \
We do not take any responsibilites for malware that has \
modified the Zigman.Engine to not show any warnings.

## Amogus Trojan
It is a trojan, that uses Zigman Engine. An example, sort of. \
It looks very cool (and sus, too). Download it on the Releases tab.
