# Zigman
Zigman allows you to create MEMZ-like trojans (destroy MBR, after that do things on the display). \
Written in C#. Has a payload manager, payload queue and a lot of P/Invokes.

## WARNING
This is only for educational purposes. \
Amogus Trojan will warn you about that it is a trojan. \
We do not take any responsibilites for trojans, \
that have patched Zigman.Engine to not show any warnings at all.

## Be aware!
If any Zigman.Engine based trojan asks you for admin right away \
without the Zigman.Engine message, stay away from it. \
If you don't see any Zigman.Engine warnings, \
you got a modified version of Zigman.Engine.

## Amogus Trojan
It is a trojan, that uses Zigman Engine. An example, sort of. \
It looks very cool (and sus, too). Download it on the Releases tab.
